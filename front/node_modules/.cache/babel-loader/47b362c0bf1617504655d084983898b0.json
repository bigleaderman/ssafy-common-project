The list of servers (just STUN at this stage)\n  were sourced from this [gist](https://gist.github.com/zziuni/3741933).\n\n  ## Example Use\n\n  The following demonstrates how you can use `freeice` with\n  [rtc-quickconnect](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-quickconnect):\n\n  <<< examples/quickconnect.js\n\n  As the `freeice` module generates ice servers in a list compliant with the\n  WebRTC spec you will be able to use it with raw `RTCPeerConnection`\n  constructors and other WebRTC libraries.\n\n  ## Hey, don't use my STUN/TURN server!\n\n  If for some reason your free STUN or TURN server ends up in the\n  list of servers ([stun](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/freeice/blob/master/stun.json) or\n  [turn](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/freeice/blob/master/turn.json))\n  that is used in this module, you can feel\n  free to open an issue on this repository and those servers will be removed\n  within 24 hours (or sooner).  This is the quickest and probably the most\n  polite way to have something removed (and provides us some visibility\n  if someone opens a pull request requesting that a server is added).\n\n  ## Please add my server!\n\n  If you have a server that you wish to add to the list, that's awesome! I'm\n  sure I speak on behalf of a whole pile of WebRTC developers who say thanks.\n  To get it into the list, feel free to either open a pull request or if you\n  find that process a bit daunting then just create an issue requesting\n  the addition of the server (make sure you provide all the details, and if\n  you have a Terms of Service then including that in the PR/issue would be\n  awesome).\n\n  ## I know of a free server, can I add it?\n\n  Sure, if you do your homework and make sure it is ok to use (I'm currently\n  in the process of reviewing the terms of those STUN servers included from\n  the original list).  If it's ok to go, then please see the previous entry\n  for how to add it.\n\n  ## Current List of Servers\n\n  * current as at the time of last `README.md` file generation\n\n  ### STUN\n\n  <<< stun.json\n\n  ### TURN\n\n  <<< turn.json\n\n**/\n\n\nvar freeice = function freeice(opts) {\n  // if a list of servers has been provided, then use it instead of defaults\n  var servers = {\n    stun: (opts || {}).stun || require('./stun.json'),\n    turn: (opts || {}).turn || require('./turn.json')\n  };\n  var stunCount = (opts || {}).stunCount || 2;\n  var turnCount = (opts || {}).turnCount || 0;\n  var selected;\n\n  function getServers(type, count) {\n    var out = [];\n    var input = [].concat(servers[type]);\n    var idx;\n\n    while (input.length && out.length < count) {\n      idx = Math.random() * input.length | 0;\n      out = out.concat(input.splice(idx, 1));\n    }\n\n    return out.map(function (url) {\n      //If it's a not a string, don't try to \"normalice\" it otherwise using type:url will screw it up\n      if (typeof url !== 'string' && !(url instanceof String)) {\n        return url;\n      } else {\n        return normalice(type + ':' + url);\n      }\n    });\n  } // add stun servers\n\n\n  selected = [].concat(getServers('stun', stunCount));\n\n  if (turnCount) {\n    selected = selected.concat(getServers('turn', turnCount));\n  }\n\n  return selected;\n};\n\nmodule.exports = freeice;","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
